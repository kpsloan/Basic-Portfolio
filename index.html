                Born in 1984, Kyle grew up in Charlotte, NC experiencing all that was fun for an early 90s kid. After graduating from high
                school, he moved to St. Augustine, Florida to attend Flagler College and pursue academics in Psychology and
                finding waves to surf. During his time in St. Augustine and Orlando, Kyle continued to develop an affinity
                for Design and aesthetic, visiting and supporting the local art community. In 2011, he moved to Boston where
                he continued his education in Advertising and worked for a startup focused on Eldercare. By 2016, he settled
                in NYC and joined a team looking to cultivate the contemporary barber culture.
                <br>
                <br> Kyle lives in NYC and has two cats that practice MMA. He enjoys traveling, adventures, biking, cooking,
                bouldering and video games. He holds a prestigious record of 105-0 in Goldeneye and loves riddles. A non-coffee
                drinker, Kyle loves a good cup of Green tea and debating the finer points of action films.
